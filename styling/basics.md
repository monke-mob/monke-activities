# User Interface Styling Guidelines for monke activities

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles for styling user interfaces (UI) in the context of monke activities. It is recommended that all UI designs adhere to these guidelines, with exceptions permitted only when they enhance user-friendliness and functionality.

## Typography

All text elements within the UI should harmonize with their respective background colors. For instance, if text appears on a black background, it should be rendered in white or yellow. These text formatting rules apply uniformly to all UI components. Text colors should be selected from the designated **Color Palette for monke activities > Text**. Additionally, text should either fill or fit the parent container appropriately, or possess a size that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding UI.

## Containers

Most UI containers should exhibit a combination of distinctive characteristics, including a border stroke, corner radius, and a solid or gradient-colored background. Notable examples of such containers include the menu and the round information display (comprising the menu button, round timer, and person count located at the bottom of the screen).

### Background

Container backgrounds should either consist of a solid color selected from the designated **Color Palette for monke activities > Backgrounds**, or a gradient chosen from the **Color Palette for monke activities > Gradients**.

### Border Stroke

Containers should be outlined with a border stroke featuring a thickness of 3. The stroke mode should be set to "Border," line join mode to "Round," and the stroke color must be chosen from the **Color Palette for monke activities > Borders**.

### Corner Radius

The corner radius for a container should be one of the following options: `Udim(0, 10)`, `Udim(0, 15)`, or `Udim(0, 20)`.

## Buttons

Buttons within the UI should adopt colors derived from the designated **Color Palette for monke activities > Buttons**. If a button is intended to function as a container (e.g., the menu button within the round information display), it should adhere to the styling guidelines outlined for containers.

By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to create a cohesive and visually appealing UI design for monke activities while ensuring optimal user experience and accessibility.
